# ParanoidPassenger
Did you know that nearly 1 in 3 adult Americans is either anxious about flying or afraid to fly?

ParanoidPassenger aims to change this by allowing users to view customized flight routes specific to their concerns. Our web app takes a starting location and destination and produces several flight paths optimized to reduce turbulence, airport wait times, and travel timeâ€”all of which are pertinent to the average paranoid passenger.

Users can click through each of the routes, ordered from best to worst, and make relative comparisons according to their phobias. Our app queries real-time turbulence data from NOAA, up-to-date security checkpoint wait time reports provided by the TSA, and distance data using the JetBlue dataset in combination with the Google Distance Matrix API. We are also in the process of developing an airport terminal rating system to further ensure passengers feel most at ease.
